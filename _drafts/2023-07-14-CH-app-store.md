## üìå Context

While working at the [TULiP Lab](https://www.tuliplab.ca/), I was the project manager on several research projects, including an online mental health program called [Couple HOPES](https://couplehopes.com/). The team developed a companion app to go with the web platform, and I was tasked with creating the app store product page content. Following the App Store and Google Play style guidelines, I crafted all elements of the product pages to spec, including the description, screenshots and logo.
