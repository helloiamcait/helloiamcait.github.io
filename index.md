{: .highlight }
Currently seeking technical writing opportunities where I can leverage my skills and experience, and contribute to impactful technical documentation.

There are three main skills that I have honed throughout education and career:

1.  Researching and understanding complex concepts
1.  Organizing and simplifying highly technical information
1.  Creating engaging content tailored to targeted audiences



<!-- Combining these skills and my enthusiasm for tech led me to an interest in technical writing. -->

<!-- #### Example

 Dr. Candice Monson—a clinical psychologist—hired me to design and develop a website to showcase her portfolio and sell access to her online training workshops. I developed a Shopify website theme, set up the website, and created a user-friendly manual for non-technical administrators to maintain the website. -->
