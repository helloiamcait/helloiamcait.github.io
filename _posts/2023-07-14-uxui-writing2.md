## Context

As project manager at the [TULiP Lab](https://www.tuliplab.ca/), a large part of my job was to improve the user experience for online clinical intervetions and their recruitment websites to attract and engage new participants. I redesigned, prototyped, developed, and wrote UX and UI content for the public-facing website for one of the online interventions, Couple HOPES, which led to a 124% increase in study sign-ups.
