## 👩‍💻 Roles

Designer, Developer, Copywriter & Brand Strategist 

## 📌 Context

Dr. Candice Monson, a clinical psychologist, hired me to design and build a portfolio website with e-commerce features. She wanted to be able to sell tickets to her workshops on the website. Through research and analysis, I identified Shopify as the ideal platform, and customized a Shopify theme to meet her specific needs. I created a document to guide the client through launching her website, and included how-to guides for updating and maintaining different types of content.

## ✨ Highlights

- Designed, prototyped and developed a Shopify website that included a portfolio and an online store to sell workshop tickets
- Wrote all content, and sourced all images and graphics for the new website
