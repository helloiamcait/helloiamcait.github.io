## Roles

Designer, Developer & Brand Strategist 

## Context

Dr. Candice Monson, a clinical psychologist, hired me to design and build a portfolio website with e-commerce features. She wanted to be able to sell tickets to her workshops on the website. Through research and analysis, I identified Shopify as the ideal platform, and customized a Shopify theme to meet her specific needs. I created a document to guide the client through launching her website, and included how-to guides for updating and maintaining different types of content.
