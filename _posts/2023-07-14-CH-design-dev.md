## Roles 

Project Manager, Designer, Developer & Marketing Strategist

## Context

As project manager at the [TULiP Lab](https://www.tuliplab.ca/), a large part of my job was to improve the user experience for the online clinical intervetions being studied to make them more engaging and attract new participants. I redesigned, prototyped and developed the pubic-facing website for one of the programs, Couple HOPES, which led to a 20% increase in new users.
